PatriotBits are simple, free, worthless digital tokens that enable psuedoanonymous
transfers to anyone, anywhere on network. PatriotBit uses ancient peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing tokens
is carried out collectively by the network. 

PatriotBit is an open project and there are no "Developers." The SCIF is 10 year old software
built on a 20 year old laptop for the sake of having something to do on a Friday night. It
is designed to install and run on all NT-level Windows systems or Debian Jessie.
